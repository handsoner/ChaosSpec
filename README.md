# Abstract
  **Motivation**: Acute chest pain is a time-sensitive and critical chief complaint in emergency medicine. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and aortic dissection (AD) have highly overlapping clinical presentations, but their treatment strategies are fundamentally conflicting.  Applying antithrombotic strategies intended for AMI to AD patients often leads to fatal aortic rupture. Due to the limitations of traditional hs-cTn and CTA testing in terms of specificity, examination time, and radiation risk, there is an urgent need to develop a non-invasive, high-throughput molecular fingerprint rapid screening technology to avoid the high mortality rate caused by misdiagnosis. Furthermore, accurate grading of cardiac valve calcification burden (no significant calcification C0 vs. significant calcification C1) is also of great clinical significance for early disease warning and individualized management. Single-omics data is insufficient to fully characterize the complex pathological landscape of fatal emergencies, and traditional omics analysis is mostly based on linear assumptions, neglecting the nonlinear dynamic "phase transition" characteristics of physiological systems evolving from "steady state" to "disorder" during the onset of emergencies. This study, for the first time, combines chaos theory with multimodal data, exploring a deep fusion paradigm of chaotic features and multispectral omics data. By mining the nonlinear characteristics of physiological systems during the phase transition of emergencies, it compensates for the shortcomings of traditional linear omics analysis in capturing complex biological dynamic evolution information.
  **Result**: The ChaosSpec framework proposed in this study utilizes phase space reconstruction to extract 10-dimensional chaotic descriptors, combined with intra-modal attention encoding and a dual-spectral interaction module based on low-rank factorization, achieving deep synergy between infrared (FTIR) protein panorama and Raman lipid fingerprints. Experiments show that ChaosSpec achieves an accuracy of 99.28% and an AUC of 99.98% in the differentiation of fatal chest pain, and a classification accuracy of 96.60% (AUC=1.0) for valve C0/C1 classification.  The model parameters are only 0.22 MB, and the Flops are 0.0069, demonstrating the potential for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices. Spectroscopic interpretability analysis, by correlating the evolution of protein secondary structure in the amide I band with lipid/protein degradation signal gradients, revealed underlying pathophysiological and biochemical mechanisms, thus strongly validating the biological credibility of the model's decisions.
